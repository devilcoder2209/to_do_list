This is a fundamental implementation of a to-do with Javascript and CSS. This to-do list helps both add and delete operations. When you input a task within the “add task” area and press enter it is added to the pending list. When you click on an object within the pending list its response gets removed. The utility has an enticing using colour scheme both in daylight and dark mode and is also smartphone and tab responsive.
